            The word "greatness" simply means the "quality" or state of being
            "great" Historically, mahatma gandhi, has and will always be a great
            man, mahatma was a man full of gretaness untill his last breathe, he
            was affirmatly a man with large interest in the wellbeing of his
            country, Mohandas karamchand Gandhi has he was first known , was
            born on the 2nd october 1869 into a gujarati hindu modh bania family
            in porbandar (also known as sudamapuri) a costal town on the
            kathiawar peninsula and part of the small princely state of
            porbandar in the kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father,
            karamchand uttamchand Gandhi(who was born on 1822 and died 1885),

            human and the world and specificaly to indians. his memories should
            never depart from our hearts. with this and more, i can really vow
            that Mahatma-Gandhi was indeed the greatest in his century. Keep
            Resting In Peace my HERO

            Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our live, and there
            is darkness everywhere, and i do not quite know what to tell you or
            how to say it. Our beloved leaders, BAPU as we called him, the
            father of the nations, is no more, perhaps i am wrong to say that;
            nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for
            these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace
            rom him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for
            millions in this county .By Prime Minister "Jawaharial Nehru".
            Indeed the light as gone out of our life, the world is now being
            mess up, no father to take care of the nation, it has been a long
            century , since the IROKO TREE has falling, and untill now, there is
            no replacement. long live Mahtma Gandhi, long live india, long live
            the nation at large.
